Identifies when a built-in utility is used to decode and decrypt a payload after a macOS disk image (DMG) is executed.
Malware authors may attempt to evade detection and trick users into executing malicious code by encoding and encrypting
their payload and placing it in a disk image file. This behavior is consistent with adware or malware families such as
Bundlore and Shlayer.
